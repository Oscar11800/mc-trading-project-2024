What is momentum day trading:
    momentum trading waits for stock price to move and then buys/sells as early as possible. BUY HIGH SELL HIGHER, buy a stock that has already moved up. 7 AM predictable momentum (when brokers open). Buy when number of sellers thin out (about to break the dam and rise in momentum).
    Strat: check performance of every stock over the last n (12) years, buy top n (10), hold portfolio for 1 month. 

    Algorithm:
Buy if lookback days has significant mean positive returns
Sell if lookback days has significant mean negative returns
Parameters/Inputs
Lookback (# of days)
Standard deviation threshold (determines trading signals)
Intuition:
Lookback returns can signal us whether the market is in an uptrend or downtrend.
If there is an uptrend, we expect it to continue to rise and buy.
If there is a downtrend, we expect it to continue to fall and sell.


Breakout algorithm:
Algorithm
On Monday morning, note the Opening Price
Place a buy stop 50 ticks above
Place a sell short 50 ticks below
Set Stop to 60 ticks in opposite direction of traded price
Exit all positions on Friday Afternoon
Parameters
Entry Thresh (# of ticks above to place the buy stop)
Exit Thresh (# of ticks below to place the sell short)
Intuition: We aim to capture weekly trends in their earliest stages, and expect volatility to increase with large price movements, allowing us to follow a price trend.



    Data: Usually price series
Technical Indicator: E.g. Moving Average
Feedback: Information from technical indicator, e.g. MA1 > MA2
Assumptions: What we expect to happen based on Feedback (e.g. Momentum)
Signal: Action to perform, e.g. buy
